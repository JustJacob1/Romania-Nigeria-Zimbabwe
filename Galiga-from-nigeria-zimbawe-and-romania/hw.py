Temperature Converter:

Problem: Write a function celsius_to_fahrenheit that takes a temperature in Celsius as an argument and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Use the formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32.


def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
  fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32
  return fahrenheit

celsius_temperature = 25
fahrenheit_temperature = celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius_temperature)
print(f{celsius_temperature}°C is approximately {fahrenheit_temperature:.2f}°F")

Calculator:


Problem: Create a function that takes three arguements for the first number, the second number, and an operator. Depending on what operator you use in the function call, the function either divides, multiplies, adds, or subtracts the two numbers.

Problem: Write a function fizz_buzz that takes an integer n and returns a list of strings representing the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of three, use "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, use "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, use "FizzBuzz".

I can not solve

Hint: For this problem, use modulo (%) to figure out what number is even and what number is odd. Modulo takes two numbers and returns the remainder of the two number divided.
